# CELLs
CELLs in cubed4th are Python objects, with memory being a dictionary supporting sparse memory allocation of positive/negative infinite precision integers and floating points. Memory addresses can also be strings or any object that supports the hash protocol.

# WORDs
WORDs are @staticmethod functions on library classes, with introspection used to transform the snake_cased names into actual names based on convention. Adding new lambdas from FORTH^3 is supported, as well as calling methods on the Python objects.

# JSON
JSON is deeply supported, with more to come, and as such, developers can construct strings/objects/arrarys in several convenient ways.
